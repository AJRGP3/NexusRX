Project Overview:
NexusRX is a smart desktop health assistant designed to give users fast, reliable, and privacy-focused medical support right from their own device. Built for simplicity and real-world usability, it acts as a helpful companion for understanding symptoms, exploring possible conditions, and receiving preliminary advice, all without needing an internet connection.
Powered by Google’s Gemma 3n language model through Ollama, NexusRX delivers conversational and intelligent medical insights with impressive accuracy. Whether you're dealing with common symptoms or need a deeper explanation of a condition, NexusRX responds in real time with thoughtful, easy-to-understand guidance.
What sets NexusRX apart is its offline-first architecture. Unlike typical health chatbots that rely on cloud servers and require sign-ins, NexusRX runs locally on your machine, giving you full control over your data. There’s no account needed, no data collection, and no background tracking, just fast, intelligent help when you need it most.
The user interface, built using CustomTkinter, is clean, modern, and focused on clarity. A straightforward chat experience makes it easy to describe symptoms or ask questions, while the AI assistant delivers information tailored to your input without jargon or filler.
NexusRX was created for students, families, and even small clinics looking for a lightweight yet capable tool to support everyday health needs. It is not designed to replace medical professionals, but to serve as a first line of understanding, a way to feel more informed and less anxious before visiting a doctor.
In a time when accessible healthcare tools are more important than ever, NexusRX offers an approachable, private, and intelligent solution built for everyone.
